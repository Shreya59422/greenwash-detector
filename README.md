Greenwash Detector is an AI-based tool that helps users identify misleading eco-friendly claims in product descriptions. The project supports sustainability by encouraging responsible consumer awareness.

Problem: 
Many companies use marketing terms such as “eco-friendly”, “100% natural”, “green”, and “chemical-free” without real environmental proof. This practice, called greenwashing, misleads consumers and makes it difficult for people to choose genuinely sustainable products.

Solution:
This project analyzes product descriptions using AI-based text logic to:
- Detect greenwashing buzzwords  
- Identify valid sustainability certifications (FSC, ISO, Fairtrade, etc.)  
- Generate a greenwashing risk score  
- Provide a clear verdict (Low, Moderate, or High risk)

Technologies Used:
- Python  
- Google Colab  
- Gradio (for web-based interface)  
- Natural Language Processing (text analysis logic)

Live Prototype:

SDG Alignment:
- SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production  
- SDG 13: Climate Action  
- SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities  

Impact:
The project helps users become more aware of misleading sustainability claims, supports ethical purchasing decisions, and promotes environmental responsibility.
